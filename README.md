**Description:**

I have developed a  regression model to predict car purchase amounts using a comprehensive dataset. This project involved extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of multiple regression algorithms with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Key Responsibilities:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Conducted detailed EDA to understand the distribution and relationships of variables using visualization techniques such as histograms, heatmaps, and pair plots.

**Feature Engineering:**

Removed outliers using the Interquartile range method to enhance model accuracy.
**Model Development:** 

Implemented various regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Decision Tree Regression.
**Hyperparameter Tuning:** 

Applied Grid Search and Random Search for hyperparameter tuning to identify the best model parameters, improving model performance and generalization.

**Model Evaluation:**

Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
